### Empty Entry for Yaml

For example, in _publications/2020-3-21-Dynamic-Sampling-and-Selective-Masking-for-Communication-Efficient-Federated-Learning.md , maybe there's some field I do not want to fill, but the entry still need to be there.

In this case, use "~" or null as dummy info in that entry.

### Adding author to publications

#### My changes to the YML entries

For publications, I have three fields, author before me, myself, and after me. I applied **bold** text for my own name while keeping others normal, by changing "_includes/archive-single.html" and "_layouts/single.html".



```
authors_before_me: ~
author_me: "Wenqi Jiang"
authors_after_me: ", Zhenhao He, Shuai Zhang, Thomas B. Preu√üer, Kai Zeng, Liang Feng, Jiansong Zhang, Tongxuan Liu, Yong Li, Jingren Zhou, Ce Zhang, Gustavo Alonso"
```



#### _includes/archive-single.html


This file is used as template for overall publication list.

I added one line to it.

```html
<p> <i>{{ post.authors_before_me }}</i> <i><b>{{ post.author_me }}</b></i> <i>{{ post.authors_after_me }}</i> </p>
```

#### _layouts/single.html

This file is used as template after people click one of your publications.

I added one line to it.

```html
<p> <i>{{ page.authors_before_me }}</i> <i><b>{{ page.author_me }}</b></i> <i>{{ page.authors_after_me }}</i> </p>
```
